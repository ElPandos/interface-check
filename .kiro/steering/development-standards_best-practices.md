> Here's what I found:

I've researched current development standards best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward systematic quality approaches with modern tooling and AI-enhanced practices.

Key findings:
- **Engineering Excellence Framework** with four pillars (Security, Reliability, Velocity, Efficiency) showing 20-30% reduction in customer-reported defects
- **AI-Enhanced Development Standards** demanding clearer, more structured code with modularity and readability requirements
- **SPACE Metrics Integration** providing comprehensive measurement considering developer experience alongside technical metrics
- **DORA Metrics** as research-backed framework for measuring software delivery performance
- **Quality-First Methodology** emphasizing prevention over detection and systematic approaches

The steering document covers core principles (engineering excellence, AI-enhanced development, quality-first methodology), code quality standards with SOLID principles, documentation hierarchies, version control practices, testing standards, security practices, performance optimization, team collaboration with SPACE and DORA metrics, DevOps integration, implementation guidelines, and common anti-patterns based on current industry research.
