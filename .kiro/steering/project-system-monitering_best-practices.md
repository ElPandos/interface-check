> Here's what I found:

I've researched current project system monitoring best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward observability-first approaches, prevention-focused methodologies, and AI-enhanced monitoring capabilities.

Key findings:
- **Observability has replaced traditional monitoring** with focus on understanding "why" systems behave, not just "what" happens
- **Three pillars foundation** (metrics, logs, traces) provides complete system visibility and introspection
- **Alert fatigue affects 80% of teams** - 71% of alerts are just noise requiring intelligent filtering strategies
- **Zero-instrumentation monitoring** using eBPF reduces overhead while providing comprehensive visibility
- **SLO-based alerting** focuses on business impact rather than infrastructure signals

The steering document covers core principles (observability-first approach, prevention-focused methodology, intelligent alerting), essential practices (three pillars implementation, service level management, modern monitoring approaches), quality assurance practices, implementation guidelines with 4-phase approach, success metrics, and comprehensive anti-patterns coverage based on current industry research.
