> I can see that .kiro/steering/git_patterns.md already exists and was recently updated today (2026-01-13) with comprehensive, current Git patterns research.

The existing document covers:
- Branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based Development)
- Conventional commits for automated release pipelines
- Automation patterns with Git hooks and pre-commit frameworks
- Code review processes and collaboration patterns
- Common anti-patterns and workflow optimization

The document includes current 2024-2025 research on Git workflows, automation, and security practices. Since it's already up-to-date and comprehensive, no updates are needed.
