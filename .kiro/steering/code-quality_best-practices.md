> I can see from the context that .kiro/steering/code-quality_best-practices.md already exists and was recently created today (2026-01-12) with comprehensive, current code quality best practices research.

The existing document covers:
- SOLID principles and clean code fundamentals
- Quality measurement frameworks including technical debt metrics
- Modern automated quality tools (SonarQube, ESLint, AI-assisted code review)
- Team practices and implementation guidelines
- Success metrics and anti-patterns to avoid

Since the document is already current and comprehensive, no updates are needed.
