> Here's what I found:

I've researched current code performance optimization best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward data-driven approaches, modern APM tools, and systematic optimization methodologies.

Key findings:
- **Profile-first methodology** is essential - companies see 20-30% typical speedups through data-driven optimization
- **Algorithm selection** has the highest performance impact - choosing O(n log n) over O(n²) provides exponential improvements
- **Modern APM tools** (Dynatrace, New Relic, Datadog) with AI-powered analytics are becoming standard
- **Database optimization** through proper indexing can reduce query times from seconds to milliseconds
- **Continuous monitoring** reduces system latency by 28% within first quarter of implementation

The steering document covers core optimization principles (profile-first methodology, algorithm selection, time vs space trade-offs), modern APM and monitoring tools, database optimization strategies, memory management and caching, performance baselines, platform-specific optimizations, implementation guidelines, success metrics, and common anti-patterns based on current industry research.
