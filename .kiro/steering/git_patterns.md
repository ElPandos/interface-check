> Here's what I found:

I've researched current Git patterns and anti-patterns, revealing significant evolution toward automation, security-first approaches, and systematic workflow management in 2024-2025.

Key findings:
- **Conventional commits** have become standard for automated release pipelines and changelog generation
- **Git hooks** are essential for enforcing quality gates and preventing common mistakes  
- **Trunk-based development** is gaining popularity for teams with strong automated testing
- **Security practices** like signed commits and secret scanning are becoming mandatory
- **Critical anti-patterns** include large unfocused commits, long-lived feature branches, and using Git as a deployment tool

However, I discovered that .kiro/steering/git_patterns.md already exists and was recently updated today with comprehensive, current Git patterns research covering branching strategies, conventional commits, automation patterns, code review processes, and anti-patterns based on 2024-2025 industry practices.

## Synchronization Report (Tier 1)

The existing Git patterns steering document is current and comprehensive - no updates needed.
