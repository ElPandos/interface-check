> ## Summary

I've researched current security best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward Zero Trust architectures, proactive security integration, and systematic risk management.

Key findings:
- **Zero Trust Revolution**: "Never trust, always verify" has become the dominant security paradigm, replacing perimeter-based security
- **NIST CSF 2.0 Evolution**: Framework now includes governance as a core function and extends beyond critical infrastructure
- **Shift-Left Security**: DevSecOps integration can reduce remediation costs by 100x through early vulnerability detection
- **Cloud Security Maturity**: With 94% cloud adoption, understanding shared responsibility models across AWS, Azure, and GCP is critical
- **Application Security Focus**: OWASP Top 10 2025 emphasizes supply chain security and proper exception handling

The steering document covers core principles (Zero Trust, defense in depth, shift-left security), identity and access management, application security, cloud security, DevSecOps integration, NIST CSF 2.0, incident response, compliance and governance, emerging trends, implementation guidelines, and success metrics based on current industry research.
