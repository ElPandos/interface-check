> I can see that the security patterns steering document already exists and was recently updated with comprehensive anti-patterns coverage based on current 2024-2025 research. The document includes:

Core Security Patterns:
- Authentication and Authorization patterns
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure communication protocols
- Error handling and logging
- Session management
- Cryptographic implementations

Comprehensive Anti-Patterns Section:
- Authentication anti-patterns (weak passwords, session hijacking, MFA bypass)
- Authorization anti-patterns (broken access control, privilege escalation)
- Input handling anti-patterns (injection vulnerabilities, XSS)
- Configuration anti-patterns (hardcoded secrets, insecure defaults)
- Architectural anti-patterns (insecure design, poor security boundaries)

The research incorporated current findings including:
- OWASP Top 10 2025 with Broken Access Control affecting 94% of applications
- Zero Trust architecture as the dominant security paradigm
- Human error contributing to 88% of cyberattacks
- API security challenges in microservices architectures

The steering document is current and comprehensive with the latest security patterns and anti-patterns research from 2024-2025.

## Summary

The security patterns steering document (.kiro/steering/security_patterns.md) has already been updated with current research and comprehensive anti-patterns coverage. No additional updates are needed as it includes the latest 2024-2025 security patterns, OWASP Top 10 findings, and systematic approaches to preventing common security vulnerabilities.
