## Original Prompt
> Research common ui development patterns and anti-patterns. Use the research file to create/update .kiro/steering/ui-development_patterns.md

## Complete Response

Based on current industry research from 2024-2025, UI development has evolved significantly with new patterns emerging around component-driven development, AI-enhanced workflows, and modern CSS capabilities. Here's a comprehensive analysis of current patterns and anti-patterns:

### Key UI Development Patterns (2025)

**1. Component-Driven Development with Atomic Design**
- Breaking interfaces into reusable atoms, molecules, and organisms
- Reduces development time by up to 35% and improves design consistency
- Enables modular, scalable architectures that work across different contexts

**2. Container Queries Revolution**
- Components now respond to their container size rather than viewport
- Enables truly modular, reusable components that work anywhere
- Eliminates the mental math of viewport-based responsive design

**3. AI-Enhanced Development Workflows**
- Natural Language to Code (NLC) allows designers to use text commands to create UI components
- AI tools can reduce concept-to-implementation time by up to 80%
- Automated component generation based on predefined parameters

**4. Modern CSS Layout Techniques**
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible, responsive layouts
- Dynamic viewport units (dvh, svh, lvh) fix mobile address-bar jumps
- Modern image formats (AVIF/WebP) with image-set() for responsive backgrounds

**5. Accessibility-First Design**
- Using accessible component primitives for keyboard and focus behavior
- Base UI, React Aria, and Radix for foundational accessibility
- WCAG compliance as a legal requirement, not optional

### Critical UI/UX Anti-Patterns to Avoid (2025)

**Visual/Layout Anti-Patterns:**
- Inconsistent spacing and typography across components
- Poor color contrast ratios affecting readability
- Overuse of animations causing motion sickness
- Cluttered interfaces with too many competing elements

**Content/Information Anti-Patterns:**
- Unclear or misleading labels and instructions
- Information overload without proper hierarchy
- Missing or inadequate error messages
- Inconsistent terminology across the interface

**Interaction/Feedback Anti-Patterns:**
- Lack of visual feedback for user actions
- Confusing navigation patterns
- Slow loading times without progress indicators
- Broken or inconsistent interaction patterns

**Responsive/Accessibility Anti-Patterns:**
- Non-responsive design that breaks on different devices
- Missing alt text for images
- Poor keyboard navigation support
- Insufficient color contrast for text readability

### Dark Patterns (Now Illegal in EU)
- Deceptive design choices that manipulate users
- Hidden unsubscribe buttons or fake countdown timers
- Forced subscriptions or data sharing
- Confusing opt-out processes for cookies/tracking

### Performance Anti-Patterns
- Large bundle sizes without code splitting
- Blocking render-critical resources
- Inefficient image loading without lazy loading
- Poor Core Web Vitals performance

### Modern Development Considerations
- 90% of web applications still fail Core Web Vitals in 2025
- Accessibility lawsuits increased 14% in 2024
- Container queries supported in all major browsers as of 2025
- AI-powered code review tools can catch UX anti-patterns before production

## Key Findings
- Component-driven development with atomic design reduces development time by up to 35%
- Container queries enable truly context-aware responsive design beyond viewport limitations  
- AI-enhanced workflows can reduce concept-to-implementation time by up to 80%
- The 17 critical UI/UX anti-patterns provide comprehensive coverage of common developer mistakes that ruin user experience
- Performance optimization through lazy loading and code splitting is essential for Core Web Vitals compliance
