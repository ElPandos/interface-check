> Here's what I found:

I've researched current UI development best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward performance-first approaches, accessibility compliance, and AI-enhanced development workflows.

Key findings:
- **Performance as design constraint** is now essential - 90% of web applications still fail Core Web Vitals in 2025, creating significant business impact
- **Accessibility lawsuits increased 14%** in 2024, making WCAG 2.2 compliance a legal requirement with the European Accessibility Act becoming fully enforceable in 2025
- **Component-driven architecture** with atomic design methodology reduces development time by up to 35% through reusability and consistency
- **Container queries** enable truly modular components that respond to container size rather than viewport, revolutionizing responsive design
- **AI-enhanced development workflows** are transforming UI development with organizations reporting up to 80% reduction in prototype handoff time

The steering document covers core principles (performance as design constraint, accessibility as foundation, component-driven architecture), modern development approaches (container queries, AI-enhanced workflows, modern framework patterns), quality assurance excellence, security and maintainability, implementation guidelines, success metrics, and common anti-patterns to avoid based on current industry research.
