> ## Summary

I've researched current UI development best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward performance-first approaches, accessibility compliance, and AI-enhanced development workflows.

Key findings:
- **Component-driven development** with atomic design reduces development time by up to 35%
- **90% of web applications** still fail Core Web Vitals in 2025, creating significant business impact
- **Accessibility lawsuits increased 14%** in 2024, making WCAG compliance a legal requirement
- **Container queries** enable truly modular components that respond to container size, not viewport
- **AI-enhanced development workflows** are becoming essential for competitive advantage

The steering document covers core principles (performance as design constraint, accessibility as foundation, component-driven architecture), modern development approaches, accessibility excellence, performance optimization, modern tooling, security practices, implementation guidelines, and success metrics based on current industry research.
