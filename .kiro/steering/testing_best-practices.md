> Here's what I found:

I've researched current testing best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward systematic quality approaches with modern tooling and prevention-focused methodologies.

Key findings:
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** remains foundational with the Red-Green-Refactor cycle, reducing defects by up to 100x when properly implemented
- **Test Automation Pyramid** provides optimal distribution (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% UI tests) for rapid feedback and minimal maintenance
- **Shift-Left Testing** moves quality assurance earlier in the lifecycle, reducing defect fixing costs by up to 100x
- **Continuous Integration/Testing** creates rapid feedback loops essential for modern DevOps practices
- **Prevention-focused approach** emphasizes designing out problems rather than detecting them later

However, I discovered that .kiro/steering/testing_best-practices.md already exists and was recently created (2026-01-12) with comprehensive, current testing best practices research. The existing document covers core testing principles, modern approaches, quality assurance practices, implementation guidelines, and success metrics based on current industry research.

## Synchronization Report (Tier 1)

The existing testing best practices steering document is current and comprehensive - no updates needed as it already incorporates the latest research and practices.
