> ## Summary

I've researched current architecture development best practices and created a comprehensive steering document. The research revealed significant evolution in 2025 toward collaborative, evidence-based approaches with systematic decision-making processes.

Key findings:
- Architecture development has shifted to collaborative, iterative approaches emphasizing stakeholder involvement
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) have become essential for documenting decisions with context and consequences  
- Domain-Driven Design provides the foundation for complex business domain modeling
- Clean and Hexagonal architectures offer superior testability and maintainability
- Sociotechnical design principles emphasize human-technology collaboration
