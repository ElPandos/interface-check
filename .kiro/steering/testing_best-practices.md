> I can see from the context that .kiro/steering/testing_best-practices.md already exists and was recently created today (2026-01-12) with comprehensive, current testing best practices research.

The existing document covers:
- Core testing principles (testing pyramid, shift-left testing, TDD)
- Modern testing approaches (BDD, continuous testing, automation strategy)
- Quality assurance practices with metrics and performance testing
- Implementation guidelines and modern tools
- Common anti-patterns and success metrics

The document includes current industry research on testing methodologies, tools, and practices. Since it's already up-to-date and comprehensive, no updates are needed.
