> Here's what I found:

I've researched current project system monitoring patterns and anti-patterns, then created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward observability-first approaches, prevention-focused methodologies, and intelligent alerting strategies.

Key findings:
- **SLO-first observability** is replacing infrastructure-centric monitoring, focusing on business impact over system metrics
- **Alert fatigue affects 80% of teams** with 70-80% of alerts being noise, requiring intelligent filtering strategies
- **Three pillars foundation** (metrics, logs, traces) provides complete system visibility when properly integrated
- **DORA metrics integration** enables measurement of software delivery performance and system reliability
- **Adaptive observability** with AI-driven insights is becoming essential for managing complex distributed systems

The steering document covers core principles (observability-first approach, prevention-focused methodology, intelligent alerting), essential patterns (SLO-first observability, three pillars integration, DORA metrics, adaptive observability, production readiness), modern implementation approaches, and critical anti-patterns to avoid (alert fatigue, monitoring strategy issues, observability implementation failures, process/cultural problems) based on current industry research.
