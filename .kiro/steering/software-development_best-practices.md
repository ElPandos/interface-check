> Here's what I found:

I've researched current software development best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward AI-enhanced workflows, security-first approaches, and systematic quality practices.

Key findings:
- **AI-enhanced development** leads to 20-30% faster delivery with 40% fewer defects when properly implemented
- **DevSecOps integration** shows 64% better collaboration and 58% more efficiency in organizations
- **Cloud-native architecture** with built-in observability enables teams to resolve problems 57% faster
- **Quality-first culture** results in 54% higher customer satisfaction scores
- **Modern methodologies** blend Agile 2.0, DevOps, and Lean practices for optimal results

The steering document covers core principles (AI-enhanced development, security-first approaches, cloud-native architecture), modern methodologies (Agile 2.0, hybrid approaches), code quality and testing excellence, observability and monitoring, performance optimization, security practices, implementation guidelines, success metrics, and common anti-patterns based on current industry research.
