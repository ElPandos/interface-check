> I can see from the context that .kiro/steering/development-standards_best-practices.md already exists and was recently created today (2026-01-12) with comprehensive, current development standards best practices research.

The existing document covers:
- Code quality standards with SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Documentation standards including inline comments and API documentation
- Version control best practices with branching strategies and commit standards
- Testing standards with the testing pyramid and TDD/BDD approaches
- Security standards including secure coding and vulnerability management
- Performance standards with profiling and optimization techniques
- DevOps integration with CI/CD and monitoring practices

The document includes implementation guidelines, success metrics, and common anti-patterns to avoid. Since it's already up-to-date with current industry best practices, no updates are needed.

File status: .kiro/steering/development-standards_best-practices.md (already current)
