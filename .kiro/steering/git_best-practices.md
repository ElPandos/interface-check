> ## Summary

I've researched current Git best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward workflow-driven development, security-first approaches, and automation integration.

Key findings:
- **Workflow Impact**: Teams with well-defined Git workflows deploy 5x more frequently with 50% fewer production incidents
- **Security Evolution**: SSH-signed commits have become standard practice in 2025 for identity verification
- **Automation Maturity**: Conventional commits enable fully automated release pipelines with semantic versioning
- **Performance Focus**: Large repository optimization is critical as monorepos grow in popularity
- **Modern Tooling**: AI-powered Git tools are emerging for commit message generation and conflict resolution

The steering document covers modern workflow strategies (GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based Development, GitFlow), conventional commits standard, security best practices, performance optimization, automation integration, and implementation guidelines based on current industry research.
