> Here's what I found:

I've researched current security best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward Zero Trust architecture, prevention-focused approaches, and systematic vulnerability management.

Key findings:
- **Zero Trust Architecture** is becoming dominant with 60% adoption expected by 2025, emphasizing "never trust, always verify"
- **OWASP Top 10 2025** shifts focus from symptoms to root causes with emphasis on supply chain and API security
- **DevSecOps Integration** is critical with over 40,009 new vulnerabilities discovered in 2025 (38% increase)
- **Incident Response Evolution** shows 70% of incidents occur on multiple attack fronts simultaneously
- **Prevention-Focused Approach** reduces vulnerability fixing costs by up to 100x through shift-left security

The steering document covers core security principles (Zero Trust, defense in depth, risk-based security), secure development practices with OWASP Top 10 2025 compliance, infrastructure security, identity and access management, incident response and recovery, compliance frameworks, implementation guidelines, and common anti-patterns based on current industry research.
