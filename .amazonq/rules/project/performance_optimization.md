# Performance Optimization

## SSH Command Optimization
- **Connection reuse**: Share SSH connections across operations
- **Command batching**: Combine multiple commands when possible
- **Timeout management**: Set appropriate timeouts for different operations
- **Connection pooling**: Implement connection pools for high-frequency operations

## Data Processing Optimization
- **Lazy loading**: Load data on demand rather than upfront
- **Caching**: Cache parsed results for repeated operations
- **Streaming**: Process large datasets in chunks
- **Memory management**: Clean up old data points regularly

## UI Performance
- **Virtualization**: Use virtual scrolling for large data sets
- **Debouncing**: Debounce user input for search/filter operations
- **Batch updates**: Group UI updates to reduce redraws
- **Async operations**: Keep UI responsive during long operations
