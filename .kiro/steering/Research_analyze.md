> I've created a comprehensive analysis of the research capabilities based on examination of 82 research files and the research framework. The analysis reveals:

Key Strengths:
- Systematic documentation with consistent structure and quality
- Comprehensive coverage across 40+ technical domains
- High-quality outputs averaging 6,000-10,000 words with multiple authoritative sources
- Strong automation integration with steering document generation

Key Weaknesses:
- Limited cross-domain synthesis and pattern identification
- Temporal analysis gaps without trend tracking
- Manual triggering constraints missing proactive opportunities
- Quality assurance gaps in source diversity and bias detection

Critical Trade-offs:
- Depth vs. breadth (thorough individual domains vs. cross-cutting insights)
- Automation vs. quality (manual triggering ensures relevance but misses proactive research)
- Structure vs. flexibility (consistent format may constrain some research types)

The analysis includes specific recommendations for short-term improvements (cross-references, source scoring), medium-term enhancements (synthesis engine, trend analysis), and long-term evolution (research graph, predictive analysis) with measurable success metrics.
