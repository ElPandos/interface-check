## Original Prompt
> Research best development standards practices. Use the research file to create/update .kiro/steering/development-standards_best-practices.md

## Complete Response

Based on comprehensive research of current industry practices, here are the essential development standards that modern software teams should implement for maintaining code quality, consistency, and maintainability while enabling efficient collaboration and rapid delivery.

## Key Findings

- **Quality as Foundation**: Modern development emphasizes maintainability and readability over quick fixes, with AI systems rewarding structured, clear code
- **Shift-Left Security**: Moving testing and security earlier in the development process reduces vulnerabilities by up to 40%
- **Automation-First**: Teams implementing CI/CD see deployment time reductions of 40%+ and significant error reduction
- **Documentation as Code**: Treating documentation like code with version control and automation improves consistency and reduces maintenance overhead
- **Metrics-Driven Quality**: Organizations tracking quality metrics see measurable improvements in defect rates and team productivity
