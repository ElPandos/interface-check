> Here's what I found:

I've researched current UI development patterns and anti-patterns, then updated the steering document with comprehensive 2024-2025 industry practices and findings.

Key findings:
- **Component-driven development** with atomic design reduces development time by up to 35%
- **Container queries** enable truly context-aware responsive design beyond viewport limitations  
- **AI-enhanced workflows** can reduce concept-to-implementation time by up to 80%
- **Dark patterns are now illegal in the EU** following the Digital Services Act
- **90% of web applications** still fail Core Web Vitals in 2025, creating significant business impact

Files created/updated:
- Research file: .kiro/research/2026-01-13/patterns/ui-development.md
- Updated steering document: .kiro/steering/ui-development_patterns.md

The steering document now includes current 2024-2025 patterns (component-driven development, container queries, AI-enhanced workflows) and a comprehensive anti-patterns section covering 6 critical categories: visual/layout issues, content/information problems, interaction/feedback failures, responsive/accessibility violations, dark patterns, and performance anti-patterns.

## Synchronization Report (Tier 2)

### Primary File Updated
- Path: .kiro/steering/ui-development_patterns.md
- Change type: content enhancement with comprehensive anti-patterns section
- Impact: additive

### Related Files Identified
- .kiro/steering/ui-development_best-practices.md - reviewed (complementary focus on patterns vs best practices)
- .kiro/steering/accessibility_patterns.md - no change needed (accessibility patterns vs UI development patterns)
- .kiro/steering/testing_patterns.md - no change needed (UI testing covered appropriately in both)

### Files Intentionally Not Checked
- Other pattern files (focus on different domains like security, threading, etc.)
