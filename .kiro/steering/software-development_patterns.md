> Here's what I found:

I've researched current software development patterns and anti-patterns, then created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward modern architectural patterns while maintaining foundational Gang of Four principles.

Key findings:
- **15 essential patterns** (5 creational, 5 structural, 5 behavioral) provide comprehensive coverage for modern software development
- **Modern architectural patterns** including Event-Driven Architecture, CQRS, Microservices, and Saga patterns are essential for scalable systems
- **Critical anti-patterns** span 4 categories: architectural (God Object, Big Ball of Mud), design (Blob Class, Lava Flow), modern development (Pattern Overuse, Premature Optimization), and team/process issues
- **Pattern selection guidelines** emphasize the "rule of three" and starting simple before evolving to complex patterns
- **Implementation best practices** focus on documentation, team expertise consideration, and measurable impact assessment

File created: .kiro/steering/software-development_patterns.md

The steering document covers core patterns (creational, structural, behavioral), modern architectural patterns (event-driven, CQRS, microservices), comprehensive anti-patterns across 4 categories, pattern selection guidelines, implementation best practices, and success metrics based on current industry research.

- .kiro/steering/architecture-development_patterns.md - no change needed (architectural patterns vs general software development patterns)
- .kiro/steering/development-standards_patterns.md - no change needed (development standards vs software development patterns)

### Files Intentionally Not Checked
- Other pattern files (focus on different domains like UI, security, threading, etc.)
