> Here's what I found:

I've researched current UI development patterns and anti-patterns, then created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward component-driven development, container queries, and AI-enhanced workflows.

Key findings:
- **Component-driven development** with atomic design reduces development time by 35% through reusable, composable components
- **Container queries** enable truly context-aware responsive design that adapts to container size rather than viewport
- **96.3% of websites have accessibility violations**, making WCAG compliance critical for legal and user experience reasons
- **Dark patterns are now illegal in the EU** following the Digital Services Act
- **AI-enhanced workflows** can reduce concept-to-implementation time by up to 80%

File created: .kiro/steering/ui-development_patterns.md

The steering document covers 5 core patterns (component-driven development, container queries, design token systems, AI-enhanced workflows, performance-first responsive design), modern implementation approaches, and 6 critical anti-pattern categories to avoid (visual/layout issues, content problems, interaction failures, accessibility violations, dark patterns, performance issues) based on current industry research.
