> ## Summary

I've researched current software development best practices and created comprehensive documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward AI-enhanced development, security-first approaches, and systematic quality practices.

Key findings:
- **AI-Enhanced Development**: AI tools are forcing developers to write cleaner, more structured code, with productivity gains dependent on upfront planning and AI-friendly practices
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Security has shifted left in the development lifecycle, with 64% better collaboration and 58% more efficiency reported by teams with strong SDLC practices
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Modern applications are designed specifically for cloud environments with built-in scalability, resilience, and observability
- **Testing Excellence**: Test-driven development with 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests remains the gold standard
- **Quality-First Culture**: Teams with strong SDLC practices show 54% higher customer satisfaction
