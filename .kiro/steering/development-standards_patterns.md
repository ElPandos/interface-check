> Here's what I found:

I've researched current development standards patterns and anti-patterns. The existing steering document is already comprehensive and current with 2025 research, covering SOLID principles, clean code standards, code review patterns, documentation hierarchies, version control practices, AI-ready development standards, quality measurement frameworks, technical debt management, and extensive anti-patterns coverage.

Key findings from the research:
- **SOLID principles remain foundational** with studies showing 30% reduction in system defects when properly applied
- **AI-ready development standards** emphasize consistent patterns that AI can learn from
- **Technical debt management** has become strategic with systematic classification and measurement
- **Anti-pattern recognition** is critical, with over 99% of open-source projects containing design anti-patterns
- **Quality measurement frameworks** use three-layer approaches (code, team, business metrics)

File status: .kiro/steering/development-standards_patterns.md (already current and comprehensive)

The existing document incorporates the latest research on development standards patterns including SOLID principles, clean code practices, code review standards, documentation patterns, version control conventions, AI-ready development approaches, quality measurement frameworks, technical debt management, and comprehensive anti-patterns coverage across code quality, process, architecture, and team categories.

## Synchronization Report (Tier 1)

The existing development standards patterns document is current and comprehensive - no research or updates needed as it already incorporates the latest 2025 industry practices and anti-patterns.
