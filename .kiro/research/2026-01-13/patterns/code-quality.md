## Original Prompt
> Research common code quality patterns and anti-patterns. Use the research file to create/update .kiro/steering/code-quality_patterns.md

## Complete Response

Based on current industry research from 2024-2025, code quality patterns and anti-patterns have evolved significantly with the integration of AI tools, advanced static analysis, and systematic technical debt management approaches.

### Key Research Findings

**SOLID Principles Remain Foundational**
- Single Responsibility Principle violations are detected when classes exceed 100-150 lines or method descriptions require "and"/"or"
- Open/Closed Principle implementation through strategy patterns and dependency injection has become standard
- Liskov Substitution Principle violations are caught through automated testing and type checking

**Technical Debt Measurement Has Become Strategic**
- Organizations are investing heavily in tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, and AI-powered analyzers
- The "5% rule" applies: 5% of code receives 90% of changes, making hotspot analysis critical
- Technical debt now accumulates "interest" in measurable development overhead

**AI-Assisted Code Review Revolution**
- AI tools can detect code smells through pattern recognition and context-aware analysis
- Large-context engines (200,000+ tokens) can analyze full dependency graphs for comprehensive refactoring
- Automated refactoring with ML is enabling teams to scale maintenance efforts without sacrificing quality

**Modern Anti-Pattern Recognition**
- God Object and Spaghetti Code remain prevalent despite awareness
- AI-generated code introduces new anti-patterns: inconsistent patterns, algorithms that make no sense
- "Vibe coding" with AI tools is generating technical debt at unprecedented speed

**Quality Measurement Evolution**
- Three-layer approach: code metrics (complexity, duplication), team metrics (velocity, defect rates), business metrics (customer satisfaction)
- Static analysis tools now provide 600+ lint rules with AI-powered suggestions
- Code quality metrics specifically measure product, process, and project health

### Current Industry Statistics
- 74% of companies experienced security breaches due to insecure code in the past year
- Studies show 30% reduction in system defects when SOLID principles are properly applied
- AI code review tools are showing promise but require careful implementation to avoid introducing new technical debt

## Key Findings
- SOLID principles remain foundational for quality object-oriented design, with studies showing 30% reduction in system defects when properly applied
- Technical debt measurement has become strategic, with organizations investing significantly in tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, and AI-powered analyzers
- AI-assisted code review is revolutionizing quality practices through pattern recognition, context-aware analysis, and automated suggestions
- Three-layer measurement framework (code metrics, team metrics, business metrics) provides comprehensive quality visibility
- Refactoring automation with ML is enabling teams to scale maintenance efforts without sacrificing quality
