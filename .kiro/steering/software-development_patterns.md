> ## Summary

I've researched current software development patterns and anti-patterns, then created comprehensive steering documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward systematic quality approaches and comprehensive anti-pattern recognition.

Key findings:
- **The 15 essential patterns** provide comprehensive coverage for modern software development across architectural, design, and modern resilience levels
- **Anti-pattern recognition** is critical, with comprehensive coverage now including architectural, design, modern development, and team/process anti-patterns
- **Pattern selection guidelines** help teams choose appropriate patterns based on system scale, team expertise, and domain characteristics
- **Implementation best practices** emphasize starting simple and evolving based on actual needs rather than following trends

The steering document covers 15 core patterns (creational, structural, behavioral, and modern architectural), comprehensive anti-patterns section with 4 critical categories, pattern selection guidelines, implementation best practices, and success metrics based on current industry research.

## Synchronization Report (Tier 2)

- Impact: additive

### Related Files Identified
- .kiro/steering/software-development_best-practices.md - reviewed (complementary focus on patterns vs best practices)
- .kiro/steering/architecture-development_patterns.md - no change needed (specific architecture patterns vs general software development patterns)
- .kiro/steering/code-quality_patterns.md - no change needed (code quality patterns vs comprehensive development patterns)

### Files Intentionally Not Checked
- Other pattern files (focus on different domains like UI, security, testing, etc.)
