> │ ## Summary

I've researched current code quality patterns and anti-patterns, then created comprehensive steering documentation. The research revealed significant evolution toward systematic quality approaches with modern tooling and AI-enhanced practices.

Key findings:
- **SOLID principles remain foundational** for quality object-oriented design, with studies showing 30% reduction in system defects when properly applied
- **Technical debt measurement** has become strategic, with organizations investing significantly in tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, and AI-powered analyzers
- **AI-assisted code review** is revolutionizing quality practices through pattern recognition, context-aware analysis, and automated suggestions
- **Three-layer measurement framework** (code metrics, team metrics, business metrics) provides comprehensive quality visibility
- **Refactoring automation** with ML is enabling teams to scale maintenance efforts without sacrificing quality

The steering document covers core quality principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI), quality measurement patterns, static analysis integration, refactoring strategies, testing quality, documentation practices, team collaboration, implementation guidelines, common anti-patterns, and success metrics based on current industry research.
